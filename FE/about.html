            <h2>About Department</h2>
            <p>
              First Year engineering is the bridge that connects Pure Science
              with engineering practices. It aims to provide a strong foundation
              for engineering students. The Department has well-equipped
              laboratories with latest equipment’s , demonstration kits , number
              of charts ,list of experiments ,etc also department has modern
              well designed class rooms that takes care of acoustics
              ,ventilation and is well equipped for adopting modern teaching

              language courses in addition to their F.E. syllabus. A student
              from any discipline of engineering needs an understanding of Basic
              science, Mathematics and core subjects. The subjects such as
              Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry, Engineering
              Mathematics, Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Computer and
              Electronics engineering have been included in syllabus by the
              university.<br /><br />
              The department has qualified & well experienced and devoted
              faculties for improving student’s ability to understand all
