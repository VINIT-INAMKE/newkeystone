            <h2>About Department</h2>
            <p>
              First Year engineering is the bridge that connects Pure Science
              with engineering practices. It aims to provide a strong foundation
              for engineering students. The Department has well-equipped
              laboratories with latest equipment’s , demonstration kits , number
              of charts ,list of experiments ,etc also department has modern
              well designed class rooms that takes care of acoustics
              ,ventilation and is well equipped for adopting modern teaching
              aids like LCD projector ,Overhead projectors ,etc .The department
              not only believe in academically sound students but also believing
              in overall development. To achieve this we motivate students to
              take part in co-curricular and extracurricular activities by
              conducting study trips & various competitions. <br /><br />
              Department provides life leadership program, German and Chinese
              language courses in addition to their F.E. syllabus. A student
              from any discipline of engineering needs an understanding of Basic
              science, Mathematics and core subjects. The subjects such as
              Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry, Engineering
              Mathematics, Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Computer and
              Electronics engineering have been included in syllabus by the
              university.<br /><br />
              The department has qualified & well experienced and devoted
              faculties for improving student’s ability to understand all
              subject. Our faculties are eager to rectify student’s general
              problems and to provide appropriate solutions to them. F.E.
              Department plays a parental role for the newly admitted students
              by offering a teacher as (GFM- Guardian Faculty Member) for the
              batch of Maximum 20 students to have regular attention on their
              progress & continuous assessment. <br /><br />
              Student can acquire high academic acumen & skills by their
              continuous efforts. That’s why education is not a one day journey
              it is a continuous process. As you know instant growth is time
              being but organic growth is a life time growth.<br />
              <br />Overall growth of the students belonging to any discipline
              of engineering needs a firm foundation and our F.E. Department is
              bond to do this with dedication & continuous efforts.
