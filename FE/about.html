          <h2>About Department</h2>
          <p>
            First Year engineering is the bridge that connects Pure Science with engineering practices. It aims to
            provide a strong foundation for engineering students. The Department has well-equipped laboratories with
            latest equipment’s , demonstration kits , number of charts ,list of experiments ,etc also department has
            modern well designed class rooms that takes care of acoustics ,ventilation and is well equipped for adopting
            modern teaching aids like LCD projector ,Overhead projectors ,etc .The department not only believe in
            academically sound students but also believing in overall development. To achieve this we motivate students
            to take part in co-curricular and extracurricular activities by conducting study trips & various
            competitions. <br /><br />
            Department provides life leadership program, German and Chinese language courses in addition to their F.E.
            syllabus. A student from any discipline of engineering needs an understanding of Basic science, Mathematics
            and core subjects. The subjects such as Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry, Engineering Mathematics,
            Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Computer and Electronics engineering have been included in syllabus by the
            university.<br /><br />
            The department has qualified & well experienced and devoted faculties for improving student’s ability to
            understand all subject. Our faculties are eager to rectify student’s general problems and to provide

            life time growth.<br />
            <br>Overall growth of the students belonging to any discipline of engineering needs a firm foundation and
            our F.E. Department is bond to do this with dedication & continuous efforts.
