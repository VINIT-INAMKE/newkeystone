            <h2>Prof. Tushar Shinde</h2>
            <p>
              Our Engineering Sciences (First Year) Department is established in
              2012. The Department of Engineering Sciences provides the common
              foundational course covering basics of Mathematics, Physics,
              Chemistry, Electrical, Civil and Mechanical, which gives every
              student an Insite on what every branch holds. Department of
              Engineering Sciences serves as an effective bridge for students
              graduating from Junior college and poised on the threshold of a
              career in engineering. We aim towards making students familiar to
              technical subjects & bridging the gap between school education and
              professional education.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our well qualified faculty members of the department have been
              making their constant efforts to improve the student’s knowledge
              in fundamental principles and understanding of basic sciences. The
              focus of the First Year Department is to lay a strong foundation
              and foster up-to-date knowledge in mathematics, sciences and the
              rudiments of all branches of Engineering. Besides academics, the
              department also participates in the development of student’s
              communication and soft skills to boost them in the competitive
              environment.

              their learning which is conducted by various industrial experts to
              provide them with vision to tackle the upcoming path of technical
              education.
            </p>

            <p>
              The department of Engineering Sciences have proper value of
              infrastructure and commitment to provide the value education to
              the students, which is very helpful to develop first year
              student’s technical skills and eventually become good
