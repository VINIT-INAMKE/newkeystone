            <h2>HOD Desk</h2>
            <p>
              On behalf of Department of Mechanical Engineering, I take
              opportunity to welcome you all to our department. It is a distinct
              honor for me to serve as Head of Mechanical Engineering
              Department. The Department was established in the year 2012 with
              present intake of 60 students. The Department aims to provide a
              strong foundation in the fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering
              and strives to instill the engineering temper and the spirit of
              enquiry in students. <br /><br />
              It encourages the students to not only understand the concept but
              also apply them to analyze & solve the engineering problem and
              prepare them for higher study or industry. The basic knowledge of
              analysis as well as the knowledge of the principles on which
              Mechanical Engineering is based taught through the theory and
              laboratory classes by a strong team of Well Qualified and
              Experienced Teaching Staff and the Technical Support Staff.
              <br /><br />
              The department also strives to instill the engineering temper and
              the spirit of enquiry in students. It encourages the students to
              understand and therefore apply the laws through the laboratory
              classes. The department provides its students with a number of
              opportunities to develop their overall personality by
              participating in the various Curricular, Co-Curricular and
              Cultural activities held throughout the year. <br /><br />
              The students with the directions from faculty members of the
              department take very active part in organizing these activities.
