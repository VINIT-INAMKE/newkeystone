                  constructed circuit with model, to the visitors of the stall
                  thereby promoting the learning process with hands-on
                  experience. <br /><br />
                  The inaugural of the project exhibition was witnessed by our
                  head of the department Prof. R. A. Barapte. Project exhibition
                  was organized by the faculty coordinator, Prof. Suvarna Phule.

                  participating students for their innovations and new
                  experiences with the community. <br /><br />
                  The students demonstrated the working of their projects using
                  power point presentation to the visitors. HOD of Electronics
                  and Telecommunication and Computer department visited the
                  exhibition and encouraged the students by interacting with the
                  students. <br /><br />
                  The students from other classes visited the exhibition and
                  interacted with the senior students. This exhibition succeeded
                  in giving an overview of practical applications in various
                  domains with a special attention to some of the problems with
                  social relevance. The event motivated the first- and
                  second-year students to take up the project work seriously and
                  more enthusiastically. Judges guided and suggested oriented
