            <p>
              It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to Keystone School of
              Engineering. The college was found with an observation to provide
              excellent learning opportunities to the students and a great
              platform to showcase their skills. You will be glad to hear that
              our college primarily focuses on making our students a good human
              being and also a successful professional through a strategic
              teaching of both theoretical and practical aspects during the
              course of education. The examination is one method of assessing
              the student’s learning. The primary responsibility of the
              Examination cell is to ensure that all the examinations are
              conducted in a fair and systematic manner. We focus on testing the
              students based on their skills rather than their memory. We handle
              the responsibilities and duties associated with the examinations,
              such as conduction, invigilation, processing the exam results and
              so on.
